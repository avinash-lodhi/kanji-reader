# 2026-02-03 (Monday)

## Morning
- Avinash woke ~10:10 AM (slept 2:24 AM, ~7.5h sleep)
- WhatsApp number switch: Gateway now on +919110590927, messages TO +918220781212
- Notifications working! Different sender = phone buzzes ✅
- Created Rei avatar (零 kanji on purple starfield) — Avinash set it as DP
- Quick meeting at 1 PM (~10 min)

## Achievements
- **Gmail Inbox Zero**: 5000+ → 0 in 1h 12m 🎉
- Second brain system introduced (Rei captures → NotebookLM processes → Drive stores)
- Daily structure started: morning check-in + evening brain dump

## Research: Gmail Pub/Sub Setup
**Prerequisites needed (none installed yet):**
- `gogcli` v0.9.0 — Linux amd64 binary available on GitHub releases
- `gcloud` CLI — needs manual install on Linux
- `tailscale` — needs install (already configured in OpenClaw but not installed on host)
- Google Cloud project with Pub/Sub API enabled

**gogcli bonus:** Not just Gmail — also Calendar, Drive, Contacts, Tasks, Sheets, Docs
This means we could get calendar integration too!

**Setup estimate:** ~45 min with Avinash's help (needs OAuth browser flow)

**Steps:**
1. Download gogcli binary → `/home/krot/.local/bin/gog`
2. Install gcloud CLI
3. Install tailscale
4. Create GCP project + enable Gmail & Pub/Sub APIs
5. OAuth authorize gogcli with Avinash's Gmail
6. Create Pub/Sub topic
7. Configure OpenClaw hooks
8. Run `openclaw webhooks gmail setup`

## Research: ClawdHub Skills
- ClawdHub CLI broken (missing `undici` dependency) — needs fix
- Interesting skills found on awesome-openclaw-skills:
  - `google-workspace` — Gmail, Calendar, Drive with OAuth
  - `focus-deep-work` — focus sessions, distraction logging
  - `habit-flow-skill` — habit tracker with streaks
  - `gmail-manager` — Gmail management via Rube
  - `gsd` — "Get Shit Done" project planning
- 1715+ skills available total

## Conversations
- Discussed what Rei can do (capabilities overview)
- ADHD support: memory, decision paralysis, task initiation
- Daily structure: morning check-in + evening brain dump
- Privacy discussion (Tom Riddle's diary analogy!)
- Financial goals are fine to share, credentials are not
- Avinash has Google One subscription (NotebookLM access)

## Evening
- Exercise done ✅
- Dinner done ✅
- Snow's litter cleaned ✅
- Journaled with a doodle (storm brain draining into bucket — blue & red ballpoint, really expressive)
- Brain dump: rooms cluttered, Feb goals, Jan retro, home loan transfer, investments, Snow's deworming appt, GCP free credits monetization
- Good night ~midnight, wake-up set for 7:00 AM

## 🔴 Cron Disaster (Midnight)
- Set wake-up cron with timestamp `1738632600000` — **2025** instead of **2026**!
- Cron fired immediately at midnight, spawning isolated sessions
- Isolated sessions tried to "fix" by creating MORE crons → 15 total jobs
- Gateway cron RPC kept timing out, so sessions couldn't clean up after themselves
- Avinash got spammed with messages from isolated sessions explaining why they weren't sending a wake-up
- **Fix:** Directly wiped `/home/krot/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json` and restarted gateway
- Avinash said skip wake-up, he'll ping in the morning

### Lessons Learned
1. **ALWAYS verify Unix timestamps** — off-by-one-year = fires instantly
2. **Isolated cron sessions should NOT create new cron jobs** — cascading disaster
3. **When cron RPC times out, edit jobs.json directly** as escape hatch
4. Feb 4, 2026 7:00 AM IST = `1770168600000` (for future reference)

## Sleep/Wake System
- Working formula: Avinash texts "good night" → I set cron with `sessionTarget="isolated"` + `agentTurn` + `deliver=true` + `to="+918220781212"` + `channel="whatsapp"` → wakes him ~7h later
