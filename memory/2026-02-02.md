## Evening Check-in (~7:55 PM)

**Wins:**
- KanjiReader work with Rei
- Laundry done (still needs folding)

**Gaps:**
- No exercise
- Not much office work
- Task initiation is a struggle

**Tomorrow's intentions:**
- Exercise (wrist still recovering - need wrist-friendly options)
- Office work (nothing specific yet)

**Open loops:** None urgent

## Notes
- Started building daily structure system
- Avinash wants: structure, better prompting, second brain, LLM skills
- Taking it one thing at a time - starting with day structure

## Lesson Learned
- **Cron systemEvent doesn't send WhatsApp messages!** It only injects into the session internally.
- For wake-up pings, use: `sessionTarget="isolated"` + `payload.kind="agentTurn"` with `deliver=true`, `channel="whatsapp"`, `to="+918220781212"` — this spawns an agent that actually delivers the message.
- Avinash slept at 2:24 AM, woke up ~10:10 AM (~7.5h sleep)

## Feb 3 Morning
- Woke up ~10:10 AM (slept at 2:24 AM, ~7.5h)
- Meeting at 1 PM (quick, ~10 min)
- **Gmail Inbox Zero achieved!** 5000+ → 0 in 1h 12m 🎉
- Set up second brain system: Rei captures → NotebookLM processes → Drive stores
- Started daily structure: morning check-in + evening brain dump

## WhatsApp Number Switch (Feb 3)
- **Old setup:** Gateway on +918220781212 (self-chat, no notifications)
- **New setup:** Gateway on +919110590927, messages TO +918220781212
- **Result:** Notifications now work! Different sender = phone buzzes ✅
- Config: `selfChatMode: false`, `allowFrom: ["+918220781212"]`
- Config backup at: `/home/krot/.openclaw/openclaw.json.backup-20260203`
- Old credentials cleared from `/home/krot/.openclaw/credentials/whatsapp/default`
