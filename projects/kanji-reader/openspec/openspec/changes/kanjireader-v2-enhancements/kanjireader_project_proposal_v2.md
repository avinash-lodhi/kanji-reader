# KanjiReader Project Proposal - Version 2

## Goal: Enhance contextual understanding and learning experience for Japanese text.

## 1. Feature: Enhanced Pronunciation Display

### Task: Implement inline English pronunciation for Japanese text.
-   **Subtask 1.1:** Modify the display to show English pronunciations directly below each Japanese word/phrase in the main text view.
-   **Subtask 1.2:** Ensure correct alignment and readability of Japanese text and its pronunciation.

## 2. Feature: Full Sentence Audio Playback

### Task: Add a speaker button for full sentence audio.
-   **Subtask 2.1:** Integrate a text-to-speech (TTS) service for Japanese language.
-   **Subtask 2.2:** Develop a speaker button UI element to be placed at the end of the extracted Japanese text.
-   **Subtask 2.3:** Implement functionality to play the entire extracted Japanese sentence when the speaker button is tapped.

## 3. Feature: Full English Translation

### Task: Display the complete English translation of the extracted text.
-   **Subtask 3.1:** Integrate a Japanese-to-English translation service.
-   **Subtask 3.2:** Display the full English translation directly below the Japanese text and its pronunciations.

## 4. Feature: Contextual Word Interaction

### Task: Implement interactive word pop-ups.
-   **Subtask 4.1:** Develop a pop-up UI component for displaying detailed word information.
-   **Subtask 4.2:** On tapping an individual Japanese word in the main text view, trigger the pop-up.
-   **Subtask 4.3:** The pop-up should display the word's meaning relevant to the sentence context, potentially using a more advanced dictionary API or contextual parsing.
-   **Subtask 4.4:** (Optional future enhancement) Include example sentences or grammatical explanations in the pop-up.

## 5. Project Management

### Task: Update beads tasks for the KanjiReader project.
-   **Subtask 5.1:** Close/archive existing MVP-related tasks in beads (if any).
-   **Subtask 5.2:** Create new beads tasks for each of the features and subtasks outlined above.

## Notes:
-   Prioritize user experience to minimize context loss and enhance learning.
-   Consider API choices for TTS and translation services for accuracy and cost-effectiveness.
